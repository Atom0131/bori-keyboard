# Data attribution

Bori Keyboard's code is our own. The bundled dictionaries (`app/src/main/assets/dict/*.bdic`)
are built by `tools/build_dict.py`, and the phrase models (`*.ngram`) by `tools/ngram_count.py` +
`tools/build_ngrams.py`, from these open data sets:

distributed under **CC BY-SA 4.0**.
